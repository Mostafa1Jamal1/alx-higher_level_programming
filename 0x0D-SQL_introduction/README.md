Description for all the files in this directory
Any file that does't have a description is for testing purposes


`0-list_databases.sql` -> a script that lists all databases of your MySQL server.


`1-create_database_if_missing.sql` -> a script that creates the database `hbtn_0c_0` in your MySQL server.
If the database `hbtn_0c_0` already exists, your script should not fail

======================
Doctest for 2-matrix_divided.py
===============================

All the tests are for the only function in the module which is matrix_divided function


Set up for the tests
====================

    First import the function

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

    And create a matrix to test on it

	>>> matrix = [
	... [1, 2, 3],
	... [4, 5, 6]
	... ]

    Typical case is to devide the matrix by 3

	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

    The original matrix should be the same

	>>> matrix
	[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

    Can't devide by zero

	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

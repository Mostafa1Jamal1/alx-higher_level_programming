Description for all the files in this directory
Any file that does't have a description is for testing purposes


`0-square_matrix_simple.py` -> a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
- Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
- matrix is a 2 dimensional array
- Returns a new matrix:
	- Same size as matrix
	- Each value should be the square of the value of the input
	- Initial matrix should not be modified
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	- You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.


`1-search_replace.py` -> a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
- Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):
- my_list is the initial list
- search is the element to replace in the list
- replace is the new element
- You are not allowed to import any module


`2-uniq_add.py` -> a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
- Prototype: def uniq_add(my_list=[]):
- You are not allowed to import any module


`3-common_elements.py` -> a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
- Prototype: def common_elements(set_1, set_2):
- You are not allowed to import any module


`4-only_diff_elements.py` -> a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
- Prototype: def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2):
- You are not allowed to import any module
